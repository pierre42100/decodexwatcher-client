# DecodexWatcher client

## What is this ?

This project is the official client form the DecodexWatcher API. (https://github.com/pierre42100/decodexwatcherapi/). The aim of the project is to let anyone use the data provided by the API, and, of course, by the french press group "Le Monde", which offer an online service called "Decodex" which try to give a note to press websites. The DecodexWatcher offers an history of the mark given to the websites, and it is its main advantage.


## Can I run my own instance of the client ?

Yes, all you need is a simple webserver, to get faster performances when opening the client. The client doesn't require any processor, it is static and written in HTML. You can even adapt it to your needs and offer your fork of the project on Github. Of course, I'll be curious to know what you've done with my API, so don't hestitate to contact me when you integrate my API in your system.


## Does this project respect my privacy ?

Yes, of course ! The only data sent to the server are the query performed on the DecodexWatcher Server. This is a static service and it doesn't require any login.
